# MOD9_SQL_challenge
Created Entity Relationship Diagram using QuickDBD
It was a very fun activity specially EDB and using composite key for first time
Downloading the table straight from QuickDBD created all table names with double quotation marks
Did not realise it until I started the queries
However it looked neat and clean so I kept it with quotation marks and completed the assignment
Enjoyed this assignment!
